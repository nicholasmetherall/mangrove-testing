Exploring other options for mangrove detection and analysis

Index,Formula (General),Best Use Case
NDVI (Norm. Diff. Veg. Index),(NIR−Red)/(NIR+Red),Standard for greenness and general health; used in over 80% of studies.
CMRI (Combined Mangrove Recognition Index),NDVI−NDWI,"Highly Recommended. Effectively separates mangroves from other coastal vegetation by highlighting ""wet"" vegetation."
MVI (Mangrove Vegetation Index),(NIR−Green)/(SWIR−Green),Excellent for rapidly discriminating mangroves from non-mangrove terrestrial forests and water.
EVI (Enhanced Veg. Index),(Multi-band adjustment),"Better than NDVI in dense canopies; reduces ""saturation"" issues and atmospheric noise."
NDWI (Norm. Diff. Water Index),(NIR−SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR),"Used to mask out water or to identify the ""succulence"" (water content) in mangrove leaves."
